# 🌿 Tianji Body Rhythm Assessment  
### A Lumi Studio WebApp

The Tianji Body Rhythm Assessment is a lightweight, fully client-side web application that provides a modern interpretation of the **Five-Element Qi Dynamics model**.  
It is designed to help users observe personal physical–emotional rhythms through a clean, intuitive interface.

This application does **not** function as medical diagnosis.  
Instead, it serves as a **self-awareness tool** based on Tianji’s contemporary framework of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water dynamics.
